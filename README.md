This is a food vision Project in which we have chosen a very famous dataset i.e 101Food Dataset.
We have trained our model using the concept of transfer learning. We have used EfficientNet as a pre trained model to make predictions or classify different food images.
Make sure you use a powerful  GPU , standard GPU will take a lot of time to train your model. 
Main aim of this project is to make predictions more accurate than the DeepFood research paper.
